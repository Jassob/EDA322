\section{Introduction}
This is an exam kit for the course Digital Design given at Chalmers
University of Technology to second-year student on the Computer
Science and Engineering program.

The course is given by the Computer Engineering division at the
Computer Science and Engineering department.

The course is at the time of writing (2018) given in English and
therefore this exam kit is also written in English.

\subsection{Motivation}
Digital Design is a course that covers {\it a lot} and since there
usually are not very good answers to old exams it can be a difficult
course to retake if one does not attend every lecture.

This exam kit attempts to make it easier to study the course without
the aid of the lectures by including more thorough explanations and,
when needed, visualizing such explanations with step-by-step pictures.

\subsection{Structure}

This exam kit is divided into three sections:
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduction (which you are currently reading);
\item Theory \\
  contains a summary of the important parts of the course's theory
\item Quiz \\
  contains answers to quizzes given in lectures, good for quickly
  assessing what you might need to study more.
\end{itemize}
